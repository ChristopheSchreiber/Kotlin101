# Kotlin101
This repository contains a presentation of the basis of Kotlin, with some small code samples.
The presentation is defined as an Asciidoctor file (Kotlin101.adoc) and is rendered using the [reveal.js converter]
(https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js).
The generate_slides.bat script is a shortcut to generate the HTML5 slides quickly.
For more details about this conversion, have a look at [Ardemius' presentation](https://github.com/Ardemius/asciidoctor-presentation#slides-rendering-with-revealjs)
